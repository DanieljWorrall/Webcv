          <p>I lead technical operations at The Orchard, supporting our 1,200+ global users + multiple offices of varying sizes. My time at The Orchard involved restructuring the IT team, adjusting and implementing new policies to streamline services and improve the efficiency of our support team and improve customer service/experience. I was responsible for managing daily operations of the service desk, supervising our networks, servers and infrastructure. I managed vendor relationships to ensure we attained the best value for money and performance. I was responsible for my department's budgeting reviewing Capex/Opex costs.</p>
          <p class="readmoretextorc"><span class="readmoreorc">During my employment I developed and led the worldwide IT team of 7, split between EMEA,APAC,NA/LATAM. I made it a priority to ensure they could grow in fields they were passionate about offering exposure and mentorship, delegating tasks where possible. I reviewed the team's progress/performance using feedback from staff and tools, weekly 121â€™s and team meetings. In addition to my direct team I could leverage global sony technicians in regions we didn't have a solid presence in.</span></p>
          <p class="readmoretextorc2"><span class="readmoreorc2">Although the orchard was owned by Sony Music from 2015, it operated as a completely independent entity until  late 2021, due to my past employment at sony music I had valuable experience with both environments and slowly prepared to transition the orchards IT services into Sony environments. I lead Worldwide projects from global office moves and acquisitions to collaborating with business leaders on events such as live  broadcasts, Culture initiatives and Company Programmes.</span></p>

            <p class="readmoretextpulse"><span class="readmorepulse">Within my first month Pulse, the Office manager resigned, due to my experience at Restup the business approached me with the opportunity to manage both IT and Facilities in a hybrid role. I worked closely with the Vice facilities team to ensure we were compliant with regular safety checks, testing and staff training. I managed several projects throughout the office from repairs to installing a multi floor stair lift to make the building wheelchair accessible and often worked with the landlord, vendors and contractors on the building maintenance and later preparing the new office space within the Vice Main officeâ€™ building.</span></p>
